✨ About Us (Story Style for Website)
Trip Triangles Tours and Travels began its journey in 2015 with just a small Hatchback cab- Indica Vista, driven by the passion and vision of our founder Mr. Swapnil Adhao – a Computer Engineer from Pune University.
What started as a single-car service with a big dream soon turned into a trusted travel company. In 2016, Trip Triangles was officially registered as a company, following all government norms. By 2017, we proudly became a GST registered company, building credibility and trust among our customers.
From the very beginning, our mission has been simple: to make every journey safe, comfortable, and memorable. Over the years, with hard work, honesty, and the support of our loyal customers, we have grown from one car to a wide fleet of sedans, SUVs, travellers, mini-buses, and buses – serving every travel need, big or small.
Today, Trip Triangles Tours and Travels is known for:
•	🚖 Reliable cab rental services
•	👨‍✈️ Professional driver-on-rent solutions
•	🚌 Bus and corporate bookings
•	🌍 Daily Pune–Mumbai cab service
•	🎉 Group, family, wedding, and outstation trips
With more than a decade of experience, we continue to stand by our promise:
